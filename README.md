# WW2 Soldier Generator

This is a little web app which generates a character sheet of sort with a randomly generated WW2 Soldier. It was designed primarily for games like [B-17 Queen of the Skies or ](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1032/b-17-queen-skies) and [Target for Today](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160903/target-today) where you need to list your aircrew.

Really all you need is a name, but for those that enjoy the RPG aspects of these games, a little additional background is included and additional blank space is provided to track the characters advancement through the game.

## Building

If you want to build and run the app locally, it's just a React app build with create-react-app.
